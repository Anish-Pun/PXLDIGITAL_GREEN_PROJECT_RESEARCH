1. Make sure the tools are installed:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip

2. Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv lora-env

3. Activate the virtual environment:
source lora-env/bin/activate


Your prompt should now show something like:

(lora-env) Milan@Boshi:~ $

4. Now install the library:
pip install ebyte-lora-e220-rpi

5. Run your script from this environment:

Make sure you're still inside the virtual environment when you run your Python scripts that use the library:

python3 my_lora_script.py

🚨 Unsafe Option (Not Recommended)

If you must install globally, and understand the risks, you can force it with:

pip install ebyte-lora-e220-rpi --break-system-packages


⚠️ Warning: This can potentially break system Python tools. Use only if you're okay taking that risk.

🔁 Summary
Method	Safe?	Recommended?	Notes
Virtual Env	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	Best practice, clean and portable
--break-system-packages	❌ No	❌ No	Risky, could break OS tools using Python
